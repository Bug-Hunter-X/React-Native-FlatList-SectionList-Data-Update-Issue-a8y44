In React Native, when working with FlatList or SectionList, you might encounter an error where the list doesn't update correctly after data changes. This often happens when the `data` prop isn't properly referenced or updated, leading to stale data being displayed.  For example, if you modify an array directly (e.g., `data.push(...)`), the FlatList might not rerender, and the changes won't reflect in the UI.  Another potential issue is using a reference to the old data even after the state updates.
